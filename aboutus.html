            <p>Before Code Fellows, I was an Office Manager at a tech startup in Seattle.  I was drawn to problem solving and creativity in coding, and decided to make the career shift.  My hobbies include aerial yoga, traveling, and eating my way around Seattle.</p>

              <p>Prior to Code Fellows, I spent the majority of my career in the service industry as a bartender, followed by three years as an attorney doing criminal work and legal consulting.  What brought me to coding and by extension Code Fellows was a love of problem solving and being able to have a career relevant creative outlet.  In my free time I enjoy spending time with my wife and dogs on the road. </p>

              <p>Coming from the world of online video and ad tech, my background is in managing client relations. Iâ€™ve always loved creating and building new things and coding is a fun new way to do it. Outside of work I enjoy watching movies, cooking, gardening, and exploring the beautiful PNW.</p>
